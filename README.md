# OpenAI Agents SDK Experiment

This repository provides a minimal example of how to use the `openai-agents` SDK. The `notebooks/agent.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to create simple tutoring agents, add guardrails, and run them with the `Runner` interface.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai-agents
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter and open `notebooks/agent.ipynb` to explore the example.

The notebook expects your OpenAI API key to be available via environment variables. The `.gitignore` excludes any `.env` files.
